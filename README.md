# Microcontroller-Systems
Implement a pressure monitoring module in an enclosure. For this, the MPX4115 pressure sensor and the ATmega328 microcontroller are used. The sensor is simulated using another Arduino uno module. The configuration menu must allow the setting of a reference pressure and the display of the information collected from the sensor (LCD). A button will be used to set the limit pressure (with circular operation, increment to maximum and reset after). Reaching the pressure is signaled by a message on the LCD.
